Why the WARNING?
----------------

DO NOT grab these and ship them all off to a commercial printing operation without reading the following:

These models have been produced only once on my own 3d printer.  Many of them required substantial effort post-print to work.
Parts with close tolerances (threads and sliders) required extensive twisting and sliding before operating smoothly.  They
have never been tested at a 3rd party printer (Shapeways e.g.) nor are they optimized to control cost at such a place.

Printing results (precise dimensions) will vary among printers, and close tolerances in some of these models may not work well
elsewhere.  I don't know what it would cost to print all these pieces commercially, but it probably would justify buying your
own printer.  There are respectable models now available for USD 300 +/-.
